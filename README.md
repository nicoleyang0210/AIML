## Introduction
Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions. This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of machine learning algorithms and techniques, including:

*Segmentation*: Dividing a population into distinct groups based on certain characteristics.
*Classification*: Assigning labels to instances based on their features.
*Forecasting*: Predicting future values based on historical data.

And more...
