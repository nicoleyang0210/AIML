## Introduction
Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions. This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of machine learning algorithms and techniques, including:

* Segmentation: * Dividing a population into distinct groups based on certain characteristics.
Classification: Assigning labels to instances based on their features.
Forecasting: Predicting future values based on historical data.
And more...
